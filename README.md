# Tetris v2
This is a Tetris game made using JavaScript, Canvas, Express, and WebSockets.

# Setup
In the project directory, run the following,
```
npm install
npm start
```
Now go to `localhost:9000` in your browser and press space to start playing immediately. *If you are playing with others, make sure you are using http, as the app will not be able to use WebSockets using https.*

# Goal of the Game
Drop pieces to the bottom of the screen. When you fill up an entire row, they will clear and earn you points. If you fill up to the top, it's game over!
Survive as long as possible and earn as much points as possible!

When playing with an opponent, survive longer than they do and sabotage their efforts by sending them "garbage" lines.

# Controls
| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| ‚Üê (Left) | Move Left |
| ‚Üí (Right) | Move Right |
| ‚Üì (Down) | Soft Drop |
| ‚Üë (Up) | Hard Drop |
| üÜÄ (Q) | Rotate Left |
| üÜÜ (W) | Rotate Right |
| üÖ≥ (D) | Hold |
| [   ] (Space) | Pause |

Soft Drop: Manually moves the piece downward.
Hard Drop: Sets the piece immediately where the ghost piece is.
Hold: Saves the current piece for later use. If you have a piece saved already, it will swap your current piece with the one being held.

Note: You can only hold once per turn.

# Scoring
| # of Lines Cleared | Points | Garbage Lines Sent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 line | 100 pts | 0 lines |
| 2 lines | 300 pts | 1 line |
| 3 lines | 500 pts |  2 lines |
| 4 lines (Tetris) | 800 pts |  4 lines |

Note: Both Hard and Soft Drop earns you 1pt per "step" downward.
