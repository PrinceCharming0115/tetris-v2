# Tetris v2
This is a Javascript Tetris game.

# Setup
In the project directory, run `npm install` and `npm start`.

Go to `localhost:9000` in your browser and press space to start playing immediately.

# Goal of the Game
Drop pieces to the bottom of the screen. When you fill up an entire row, they will clear and earn you points.
Survive as long as possible and earn as much points as possible.
When playing with an opponent, survive longer than they do and sabotage their efforts by sending them "garbage" lines.

# Controls
| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| ‚Üê (Left) | Move Left |
| ‚Üí (Right) | Move Right |
| ‚Üì (Down) | Soft Drop |
| ‚Üë (Up) | Hard Drop |
| üÜÄ (Q) | Rotate Left |
| üÜÜ (W) | Rotate Right |

Soft Drop: Manually moves the piece downward.
Hard Drop: Sets the piece immediately where the ghost piece is.
Hold: Saves the current piece for later use. If you have a piece saved already, swaps your current piece with the one being held.

Note: You can only hold once per turn.
